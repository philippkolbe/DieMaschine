# DieMaschine
Predicting football results of the Bundesliga. I called it DieMaschine (TheMachine).

## Explanation
This repository contains the code for predicting for the popular football result prediction game kicktipp (https://www.kicktipp.com).
The model has proven to perform at super-human abilities by achieving more points than any human in a kicktipp round with more than 20 humans.

We use an evolutionary algorithm to determine the optimal parameters for a domain-specific algorithm determining winning, draw and losing probabilities of different matches.
The evolutionary algorithm determines the optimal parameters by being "trained" on past Bundesliga seasons.

## Disclaimer
This is one of my earliest programming projects (developed between around 2015 and 2019). I am proud of this project as it is .
Therefore, it should be obvious that the code quality is low and the methods utilized would not be my first choice today...
